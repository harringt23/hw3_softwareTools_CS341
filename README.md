# CS 341: Homework 3 â€“ Software Tools
Up until now your web app consists of only two files: a static .html and .css file. As projects get larger, they get a lot more complex. For example:
- Web applications consist of many files that must be managed by source control.
- Web applications have a front end (runs in the web browser) and a back end (that runs on a server). Software is required to run and configure the server.
- Source code will need be tested regularly. For this, a third party library is required.
- Apps use many third party libraries. These libraries have to be updated as required and
their interdependencies managed.
In this assignment you will setup several software tools and create a project to manage what will eventually be a very simple, complete web application.
